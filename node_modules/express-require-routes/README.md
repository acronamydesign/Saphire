# Express-Require-Routes
Require recursive routes from a directory and register them in express.

## Installation

    npm install express-require-routes

## Usage
express-require-routes expects your route files to export a function with an express app argument.

Example

    module.exports = function(app) {
        app.get('/users', ...);
        app.post('/users/{id}', ...);
    }

To require one or more routes from a directory use the following code snippet (app is an express app):

    var requireRoutes = require('express-require-routes');

    requireRoutes('routes', app)

__Attention__ Route directories have to specified relative to the current working dir (process.cwd()).
